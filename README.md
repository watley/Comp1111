# Comp1111
String encryption programs
This Repository is a repository that me and my team worked on for a comp1111 project, it's a basic computing course that teaches 
a lot of loose ends in computing. Like networking, git, linux shell and so on. SO for this course we had to do a 4 person group project/presention that revolved around some aspect of computing.  Me and my partners decided on String encryption because i found a video of someone online doing it and it seemed interesting. The whole idea of encryption was very interesting to me so i thought simple string encryption was a good place to start. One aspect of this project was to have a demo, and so this repository holds the programs that i used to demo.

So just keep in mind that i am a beginning software development student and this project is by no means complex. It was just designed to give us and the audience the idea behind cyphers, cyphertext vs plain text and other introductory encryption ideas.
