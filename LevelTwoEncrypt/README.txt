This is the LevelTwoEncrpt program that i built for the group project. It is a bit more complex than that previous LevelOneEncrypt.
This one has a couple of arrays of  ints. Random integers for all intents and purposes. The bitshifter shifts each character of the 
input string by the amount of spaces as the first int in the array. It then loops through each value in the array and applies it to 
each character. It also contains a decrypt function that does the same thing in the opposite direction making it an asymmetrical key. 
This is a lot more interesting than the previous program however, it is still far too simple to use in any sort of real way. 
Thanks.
